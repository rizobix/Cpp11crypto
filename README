	Cpp11crypto - a cryptographic library in C++11
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This must be seen more as an experiment.

I/We will be trying to deploy a crypto library written using
C++11 as a way to:
      - Practice as much C++11 new features as possible
      - Be as strictly FIPS compatible as possible
      - Use boost libraries as much as possible
      - Demonstrate that C++ is really efficient, as much
      	as, or even more than, C

Compilation and testing requieres, as a minimum, g++ v4.6.
Other compiler versions to be determined.

Anyone is welcome, but take note of two conditions:
