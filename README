	Cpp11crypto - a cryptographic library in C++11
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This must be seen more as an experiment.

I/We will be trying to deploy a crypto library written using
C++11 as a way to:
      - Practice as much C++11 new features as possible
      - Be as strictly FIPS compatible as possible
      - Use boost libraries as much as possible
      - Demonstrate that C++ is really efficient, as much
      	as, or even more than, C

Compilation and testing requieres, as a minimum, g++ v4.6 (http://gcc.gnu.org).
Other compiler versions to be determined.

Code documentation using Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 1.4.7.

Other documentation using LaTex. Using LiveTex, as it is available both in Windows
and GNU/Linux. iMac, To be determined. Editing woth TexMaker, available in all
three OS's.

Code indentation maintained with astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net).
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 2.01.
Settings found in 'astylerc' file.
