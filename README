	Cpp11crypto - a cryptographic library in C++11
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This must be seen more as an experiment.

I/We will be trying to deploy a crypto library written using
C++11 as a way to:
      - Practice as much C++11 new features as possible
      - Be as strictly FIPS compatible as possible
      - Use boost libraries as much as possible
      - Demonstrate that C++ is really efficient, as much
      	as, or even more than, C

Compiler used: g++ v4.8, from Debian/Sid
Other compiler versions to be determined.

Boost libraries used: 1.53.0. Binary libraries used: test.
Other library versions to be determined.

Printing in testing performed via FastFormat (www.fastformat.org)
Underlying library used: StlSoft (www.stlsoft.org)

Auxiliary library used for type printing: libcwd (libcwd.sourceforge.net)

Code documentation using Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).

Other documentation using LaTex. Using LiveTex 2013. Editing with TexMaker and TexStudio, available in all
three OS's.

Code indentation maintained with astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net).
Settings found in 'astylerc' file.
