	Cpp11crypto - a cryptographic library in C++11
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This must be seen more as an experiment.

I/We will be trying to deploy a crypto library written using
C++11 as a way to:
      - Practice as much C++11 new features as possible
      - Be as strictly FIPS compatible as possible
      - Use boost libraries as much as possible
      - Demonstrate that C++ is really efficient, as much
      	as, or even more than, C

Compiler used: g++ v4.7.
Other compiler versions to be determined.

Boost libraries used: 1.52.0. Binary libraries used: test.
Other library versions to be determined.
Pending: Check which boost headers used are already included in C++11 version used.

Printing in testing performed via FastFormat (www.fastformat.org)
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 0.7.1-alpha-9.

Underlying library used: StlSoft (www.stlsoft.org)
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 1.9.116.

AUxiliary library used for type printing: libcwd 1.0.4 (libcwd.sourceforge.net)

Code documentation using Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen).
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 1.8.1.

Other documentation using LaTex. Using LiveTex 2012, as it is available both in Windows
and GNU/Linux. iMac, to be determined. Editing with TexMaker, available in all
three OS's.

Code indentation maintained with astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net).
Exact minimum version to be determined, using 2.03beta.
Settings found in 'astylerc' file.
